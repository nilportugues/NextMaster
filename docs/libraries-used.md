# Libraries and Technologies

This document outlines the key libraries, frameworks, and technologies used in the NextFaster project. Understanding these components is essential for development and contribution.

## Core Framework & Platform

### Next.js 15
- **Description**: Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Version 15 introduces features like improved Server Actions and Partial Prerendering (PPR), which are leveraged in this project.
- **Usage**: Powers the frontend rendering, server-side logic (via Server Actions), routing, and overall application structure. Partial Prerendering is used to precompute page shells for performance, with dynamic data streamed in.
- **More Info**: [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)

## Package Manager

### PNPM
- **Description**: PNPM is a fast, disk space-efficient package manager.
- **Usage**: Used for managing all project dependencies and running scripts defined in `package.json`.
- **More Info**: [PNPM Documentation](https://pnpm.io/motivation)

## Database & ORM

### Neon Postgres
- **Description**: Neon is a serverless Postgres platform, offering scalable and managed PostgreSQL databases.
- **Usage**: Serves as the primary database for storing all application data, including products, user information (if applicable), and orders.
- **More Info**: [Neon Documentation](https://neon.tech/docs)

### Drizzle ORM
- **Description**: Drizzle ORM is a TypeScript ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) known for its performance, type-safety, and developer experience.
- **Usage**: Used to define the database schema (typically in `src/db/schema.ts`) and to query the Neon Postgres database in a type-safe manner. It facilitates database migrations and schema management (e.g., via `pnpm db:push`).
- **More Info**: [Drizzle ORM Documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview)

## Storage

### Vercel Blob Storage
- **Description**: Vercel Blob provides a robust solution for storing files, such as images, videos, and other static assets.
- **Usage**: Utilized for storing product images. Images generated or processed are uploaded to and served from Vercel Blob.
- **More Info**: [Vercel Blob Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob)

## AI & Content Generation

### OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini) & Vercel AI SDK
- **Description**: OpenAI provides powerful language models like `gpt-4o-mini`. The Vercel AI SDK offers tools and helpers to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into Next.js applications.
- **Usage**: Leveraged via OpenAI's batch API in conjunction with the Vercel AI SDK to generate product categories, names, and descriptions, enriching the e-commerce site with unique content.
- **More Info**: [OpenAI API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs), [Vercel AI SDK Documentation](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs)

### GetImg.ai (stable-diffusion-v1-5)
- **Description**: GetImg.ai is an image generation service. The project uses the `stable-diffusion-v1-5` model via this service.
- **Usage**: Employed to generate product images, providing diverse visual content for the e-commerce listings.
- **More Info**: [GetImg.ai](https://getimg.ai) (Note: Specific model documentation might be part of the broader Stable Diffusion or GetImg.ai platform materials.)

## UI Development

### v0.dev
- **Description**: v0.dev is a generative UI system by Vercel. It enables developers to create user interfaces from text prompts or by iterating on pre-built components, often outputting React code that uses Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS.
- **Usage**: Utilized to generate the initial UI for various components and pages in the project, significantly accelerating the frontend development process. Examples include search dropdowns, order pages, and login pages.
- **More Info**: [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)

### Tailwind CSS
- **Description**: A utility-first CSS framework designed for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **Usage**: Provides the styling foundation for the application. It's used extensively within components generated by v0.dev and for all custom styling needs.
- **More Info**: [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

### Shadcn UI (Implied by v0.dev)
- **Description**: Shadcn UI is a curated collection of re-usable UI components for React, built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. It is not a component library in the traditional sense but rather a set of components that can be copied into a project.
- **Usage**: Many UI elements in this project likely originate from Shadcn UI patterns or components, as v0.dev commonly generates code based on them.
- **More Info**: [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

This list covers the primary technologies. Developers should familiarize themselves with these tools to effectively contribute to the NextFaster project.
